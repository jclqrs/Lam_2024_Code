# TT-seq analysis

# Calculate gene-level counts with htseq
Gene-level counts were calculated with htseq for both sample and spike-in alignments. An example bash script is provided:

`sbatch run_htseqcount_samples.sh`

# Differential analysis with DESeq2
Differential gene expression analysis was performed with DESeq2. An example jupyter notebook is provided:

`DESeq2_ttseq_spikein.ipynb`
